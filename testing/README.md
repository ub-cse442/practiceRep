# Election and Data Science
We extracted and visualized relevant data of 2016 and past US President Election. 
</br>
</br>
All of our works are present in this website: 
</br>
### http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~skim43/cse_442/
</br>
To explain about the details of the website, it has four different tabs: Home, Data, Twitter Analysis, and Speech.

- ***Home***
</br>
Home page is filled by Donald Trump's big picture with our team's name. Donald Trump deserves to be in the main page as he won 2016 US President Election


- ***Data***
</br>
Data tab shows 5 different tabs for each Election year since 2000. If you click the tab of any year, it will show the US Map with red or blue colors with different shade.
</br>The darker red shade, the more Republican poll results and the darker blue shade, the more Democratic poll results. If you hover any State, it will show the poll results of the State between Republican and Democratic.
</br>2016 tab is a bit more special as it shows all aggregated poll results since 2000 by hovering, and if you click the State, it will direct you to a new webpage showing the poll results as well as the colored county map.



- ***Twitter Analysis***
</br>
Twitter analysis tab has the data visualizations and analysis of data collected from Twitter. The twitter data collected consisted of mentions of the presedential candidates in a good and neutral way from each state. The data was plotted in a graph for each candidate to come to conclusions on general opinion of the nation.

- ***Speech***
</br>
Shows visual graphs of analysis of the whole past Presdients' speech. We counted the number of words for specific important words they spoke, and how many words there are in each sentence on average.
